# Commit Guidelines

When working on a large project with multiple users, it's a good idea to follow
a convention for committing in Git. A guide that we follow is
https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/. The purpose of this document is not to
be nitpicky â€“ instead, the goal is to help provide some guidelines on what is a
good commit message. These guidelines are general, and apply to most projects
that use Git.

Here's a summary:

- Separate subject from body with a blank line
- Limit the subject line to 50 characters (this is a guide but not strictly
  enforced)
- Capitalize the subject line
- Do not end the subject line with a period
- Use the imperative mood in the subject line
- <strike>Wrap the body at 72 characters</strike> (this is not strictly
  enforced)
- Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
- Do not put internal bug numbers in the commit subject since it takes up the
  recommended 50 characters
- The commit log is _not_ a diary - keep it short and relevant to the project,
  not to what a developer is thinking at that moment. Longer discussions can be
  had in the PRs.
- Because we use squash and merge, ensure that the final squashed commit message
  makes sense.
  - No WIP markers in the subject
  - No DO-NOT-MERGE markers in the subject
  - No MyName/branchname in the subject

Here's an example of a good and easy to read commit log showing only the subject
(slightly modified from our git log output)

Here's an example of a good and easy to read commit message (after everything has been squashed)

```

* Ignore warnings and CLI update messages when using --json
* Remove integration tests for setting eslint
* Clean up yarn lint

### Committing

1. We enforce commit message format. We recommend using [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) by installing it with `npm install -g commitizen` and running `npm run commit-init`. When you commit, we recommend that you use `npm run commit` which will prompt you with a series of questions to format the commit message. Or you can use our VS Code Task `Commit`.
1. The commit message format that we expect is: `type: commit message`. Valid types are: feat, fix, improvement, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore and revert.
1. Before commit and push, husky will run several hooks to ensure the commit message is in the correct format and that everything lints and compiles properly.
