- Metadata types with content are composed of two files: a content file (ie MyApexClass.cls) and a -meta.xml file (i.e MyApexClass.cls-meta.xml). You must include both files in your .forceignore file. Or try appending “\*” to your existing .forceignore entry.

See <https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_exclude_source.htm> for examples

Additional suggestions:
Confirm the file name, extension, and directory names are correct. Validate against the registry at:
<https://github.com/forcedotcom/source-deploy-retrieve/blob/main/src/registry/metadataRegistry.json>

If the type is not listed in the registry, check that it has Metadata API support via the Metadata Coverage Report:
<https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/metadata-coverage>

If the type is available via Metadata API but not in the registry

- Open an issue <https://github.com/forcedotcom/cli/issues>
- Add the type via PR. Instructions: <https://github.com/forcedotcom/source-deploy-retrieve/blob/main/contributing/metadata.md>
