# Library Examples

This directory provides code samples and guides describing how to use library functionality. We recommend referencing the [Component Resolution]('./component-resolution') example first, since resolving components is fundamental to using the rest of the library.

## Examples

- [Component Resolution]('./component-resolution') - Scanning components in a file system, through manifest files, and other means
- [Deploy]('./deploy') - Deploying components to an org
- [Retrieve]('./retrieve') - Retrieving components from an org
- [Package Creation]('./package-creation') - Package functionality like generating manifest files and converting source
