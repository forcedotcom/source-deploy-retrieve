# Library Examples

This directory provides code samples and guides describing how to use library functionality. We recommend referencing the [Component Resolution]('./component-resolution') example first, since resolving components is fundamental to using the rest of the library.

## Examples

- [Component Resolution](./component-resolution) - Scanning components in a file system, through manifest files, and other means
- [Deploy](./deploy) - Deploying components to an org
- [Retrieve](./retrieve) - Retrieving components from an org
- [Package Creation](./package-creation) - Package functionality like generating manifest files and converting source
